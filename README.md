The project for COMP30022 is to develop a personal ePortfolio system.
The ePortfolio system must be capable of allowing you to submit individual guest lecture reports
and end-of-subject individual reflections that are requirements in COMP30022, as well as a team report.
You will be assigned a client in addition, specifically a Masters student (or group of Masters students) studying SWEN90016.
The Masters students will be assigned in Week 3 of the semester.
